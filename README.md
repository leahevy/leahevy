<b>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://evyli.de/about">Leah</a>.</b> ❤️

<hr />

I am a software developer from Germany, Frankfurt area. I like to develop in Python since many years.

I worked as a [researcher](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) in the field of High-Performance computing in the [European Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/). Currently I work in the field of conversational AI using ML and Python.

- 💼 I'm a Backend developer

I'm skilled in the languages: *Python*, *Java*, *C*, *C++*, *Google Go*, **and** *Haskell*.

I blog recently on <a href="https://evyli.de">my blog</a>, mostly about programming/coding topics. Particularly, in the Python programming language. You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://evyli.de/feed.xml) on my page.

Particularly, I'm interested in carrying out research in the area of *High-Performance-Computing* and *Machine-Learning*.
You can find my recent publications [here](https://evyli.de/resume#publications).

When I'm not programming or doing science, I'm engaging politically in a leftist movement and supporting the **LGBT** community.
I love reading sci-fi literature (e.g. the works from Isaac Asimov) as well as fantasy. I also do paintings and write novels myself and I love robotics and tech generally.
